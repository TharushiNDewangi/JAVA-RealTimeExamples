a) Create a Student class with the properties studentID (int), name (string), degree
(string), mobile (string). 
b) Create a constructor for the Student class to set values for name, degree and mobile
number. The studentID should be generated by the system making use of a static 
property called max which is initialized to 100 initially to assign a unique value for each 
student id.
c) Create setters and getters for name, degree and mobile
d) Create a print() method to print details of a student.
e) Create a static method called getNextStudentID() to return the next studentID
f) Create a separate class called StudentApp with the main method.
g) Create an array of Student of objects. Instantiate 5 Student objects using the 
constructors and the setters you have developed. 
h) Display the details of all the 5 students making use of the for loop.
